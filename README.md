# 2D-Graphics-Engine
2D graphics engine that was made in my 2D Graphics course.

All of files that I made can be found outside of all the folders except for the MakeFile and image.exe which were provided initially. Expected folder contains the expected images the engine is supposed to make while the actual folder contains the actual images that the engine makes. All other code provided by instructor Mike Reed.
